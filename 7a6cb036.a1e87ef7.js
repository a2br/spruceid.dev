It also increases the control and privacy enjoyed by individuals and smaller companies.

These brands go great lengths to build trust and credibility, including background checks, million-dollar home guarantees, reputation systems, and online dispute resolution. This is also why people are generally not okay sending a transaction to a random hash address on a publicly-viewable blockchain and then stepping into the next car that pulls up. We think that verifiable information is critical enabling the three pillars of market design, a theory in which the economist Alvin Roth stipulates the necessity of thickness, congestion, and safety across all markets."),Object(o.b)("p",null,"To ensure compatibility with peer-to-peer ways to transact, we must also adopt peer-to-peer ways to handle the issuance, transfer, and verification of trusted information. Consider a rideshare driver selling services within a decentralized marketplace who presents a valid license and driving history digitally-signed by the local DMV, proof of insurance from Geico, and a clean background check issued by Checkr (the same company used by Uber), all privately and securely without an intermediary. With this model, we are that much closer to a reality in which the trust portion of transaction costs within a decentralized market are no longer prohibitive, and the platform\u2019s take of the revenue moves from 25% to $0.25. The surplus goes to the consumers and actual service providers."),Object(o.b)("p",null,"We therefore think decentralized identity is important because it is beneficial to user control and privacy while also making good business sense.
