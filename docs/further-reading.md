Further educational/contextual resources on decentralized identity topics can be
found on the [Education page](https://identity.foundation/education/) of the
Decentralized Identity Foundation. 

For insight into the core specifications authored and maintained by the W3C
working group, the best overview is the github repositories section of their
[homepage](https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/) on W3.org. The largely overlapping
[Credentials Community Group](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/), with weekly open,
recorded, and scribed [calls](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/meetings/) open to W3C
non-members, is also a good venue for getting to know the debates around the
core specifications.
