no idea what goes here yet, bear with me. I'm of two minds:

1. we can nix the whole section, which would be easier than figuring out how to turn off the high-light color when you're browsing a subsection (god this "alpha v.40 is full of infuriating minor bugs, and the documentation is totally lacking! so much for "versioning your docs to be in line with your releases," faceboogers.). i'm similarly baffled about what to do with the home page at domain root...
   1. see also the [blog as homepage](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/blog/#blog-only-mode) option 
2. Or, if it makes sense to have a general dev lobby outside of the blog and product docs, we could use this space forrandom articles like "why we're so into Rust" and "why you should do an Udemy on SSI cuz we'll have a labor shortage in two years". or we could get really aggro and put in an article like, "why aries isn't w3c-compliant [yet/still]", if we're feeling spicy. 
   1. to be honest, there's lots of good content already in the blog-- pulling extracts from that, I think a few case-studies or articles wouldn't take long to frankenstein together.
