# Rust Crate

Spruce is very proud to build all its core products to date using the
Rust language, which offers a secure, performant, and memory-safe
alternative to the dominant development languages of today. If you
are planning to interact with DIDKit directly in Rust from a broader
Rust project, you may find useful our separate Rust-specific 
[documentation site](https://rust.didkit.dev/). Note that many of the
DIDKit functions and traits in turn call [ssi](https://rust.didkit.dev/ssi/)
functions.

## Crates.io

DIDKit can also be downloaded & updated from crates.io, Rust's native
package manager, from inside projects (coming soon).
