# Why Rust 

Spruce is very proud to have built these core products to date using
the Rust language, which offers a secure, performant, and memory-safe
alternative to the dominant web development languages of today. If you
are planning to interact with DIDKit directly in Rust from a broader
Rust project, you may find useful our separate Rust-specific 
[documentation site](https://rust.didkit.dev/). Note that many of the
DIDKit functions and traits in turn call functions and traits in 
[ssi](https://rust.didkit.dev/ssi/), a separate package/crate on which
it depends.

## Crates.io

DIDKit can also be downloaded & updated from crates.io, Rust's native
package manager, from inside projects (coming soon).
