## DIDKit changelog

{@import ../../../didkit/CHANGELOG.md}

Note also that the core library /ssi/ also has its own changelog, where low-level functions get added to be wrapped/exposed by DIDKit. Note: DIDKit pulls the newest `ssi` by commit-specific dependency calls, so the version numbers are not "locked" to each other and hotfixes or minor features are often applied in between major versions.

## SSI changelog

{@import ../../../ssi/CHANGELOG.md}
