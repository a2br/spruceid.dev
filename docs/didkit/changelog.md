# DIDKit changelog

*Note: the core library `/ssi/` also keeps its own, distinct changelog, where
low-level functions get added to be wrapped/exposed by DIDKit's various
interfaces. DIDKit pulls the newest `ssi` by commit-specific dependency calls,
and the version numbers of the two libraries are not "in lockstep"; hotfixes or
minor, "nightly" features are often pulled into DIDKit from ssi between major
versions.*
