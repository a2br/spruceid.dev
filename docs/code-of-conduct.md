## Open Source is Community

Speech is free, but speech has consequences. We at Spruce bring decades of
community and open-source experience to the table, and it has taught us that
good community is only possible with proactive effort and structure. To this
end, we would like to invite you familiarize yourself with the long history of
open source bottoms-up governance leading up to the "rulebooks" we follow.

## The Rules

Some large, veteran-filled communities have invested significant time and effort
formulating very specific rulebooks, full of normative and non-normative
statements worded as testably as possible. Pick whichever one fits your learning
style best and study it closely: all roads lead to Rome, and taking on any of
them in good faith will guarantee your contributions and communications in our
corner of the open source world will be well-received in good faith.

As with all open-source-- if you see a typo or want to propose a feature
upgrade, open an issue! All of these are hosted on git for this very purpose.

## When in doubt, call a referee

Our Open Source Manager (aka our "OS Yenta") prioritizes these questions and 
dispute resolution generally, so feel free to 
[reach out](mailto:oss@spruceid.com) early and often if you see a dispute or a
conflict coming.
