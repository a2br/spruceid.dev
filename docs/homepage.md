## Get Started

Welcome! Here's how you can get started building with our open-source projects:

- [DIDKit](/docs/didkit) - our cross-platform toolkit for W3C
  Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials.
- [Credible](/docs/credible) - our lightweight credential wallet, demonstrating
  how DIDKit can be built into a native mobile app.

Want to learn more about verifiable credentials? Start
with our [primer](primer.md), or use the
[glossary](glossary.md) to go deeper into corner-cases and specifications.

## Our Vision at Spruce

When’s the last time you felt comfortable sending or receiving important
documents digitally? Have you ever been shocked at how much an online platform
knows about you and wish you had more control over your identity? As a business,
do your customers feel any of the above when they’re doing business with you?

> **Spruce is reimagining trusted interactions for enterprises and governments — the
> stewards of the most foundational and impactful layers of infrastructure shaping
> our lives.**
 
We believe that in any organization you can find people working to build
institutions that honor individual’s control over their own information and
privacy.  We are also pragmatists who understand that these principles are most
likely to be implemented at scale when they also make commercial and operational
sense. We firmly believe that there are paths striking a balance that both
respects individual liberty and allows for enterprise success.

We are creating open-source software products that help our customers go from
untrusted data to verifiable information that can be shared privately and with
consent. Our products enable complete lifecycle management for licenses,
certificates, audit reports, registrations, and other mission-critical data that
must remain secure while passing many hands. Our main workflows allow end-users
to manage their own data, and for everyone else to have confidence in the
consent and purpose of data shared by them. To achieve this, we will utilize a
cadre of emerging data technologies, including the recent W3C Verifiable
Credentials and W3C Decentralized Identifiers specifications, which have been
designed to solve business problems while leaving ample room to champion the end
user’s control within a data supply chain.

_Please note: this site documents two different v0.1 products that have not yet
undergone substantial external review. They are presented as functional alphas
for experimentation and to show the direction of the projects (inviting
proposals for changes of direction, even!). They are not, however, intended for
transacting real-world business just yet._
