class="hash-link" href="#what-would-it-look-like-to-have-a-more-secure-social-security-number" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>In today‚Äôs digital world, individuals are approximated by combining and cross-referencing as many as possible of the documents and connections that form their ‚Äúidentity.‚Äù We are glimpsed through these collections of numbers, letters, visual representations, verbal and non-verbal affirmations that confirm or betray our own claims about ourselves. Some pieces of information are inherent to an individual such as a photograph, while others are assigned such as a driver‚Äôs license number, or name on a birth certificate. In America, individuals are often assigned a number of assigned identifiers at birth, with one standing beyond all others as a critical but high-risk identifier: the social security number.</p><p>The optional nine-digit social security number (SSN) is at the core of every American‚Äôs administrative identity ‚Äî and it is also a major attack vector for most kinds of financial fraud. It was originally <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v45n11/v45n11p29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">developed and deployed as a unique identifier</a> in the 1930s in order to track an individual‚Äôs wages over time. This was a critical activity to assess future government benefits under the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/ssact-toc.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Social Security Act</a>, as well as supporting other critical functions such as linking federal income tax and payroll accounting. In a pre-digital age, it became important as a federally issued unique identifier and found its way into most major government institutions from there, binding individuals to all kinds of records about them. Eventually, it became a means to enable the employment of an individual, and a requirement to access financial services and government-backed assistance programs.</p><p>Today, institutions will commonly request an SSN along with other supplemental forms of identity verification to create stronger guarantees that each individual has been reliably identified. In these cases, where it supplements identity assurance, it is being used as an ‚Äú<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2017/10/23/ssn-for-authentication-is-all-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">authenticator‚Äù in addition to an identifier</a>. But it is as valuable to falsify identification as it is to verify it: it is a valuable target for malicious actors due to the plausibility and control it grants upon presentation when impersonating its proper subject.</p><p>Considering the increasing severity and frequency of digital breaches in recent years, it wouldn‚Äôt be unreasonable to believe that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/suzannerowankelleher/2019/08/01/everyones-social-security-number-has-been-compromised-heres-how-to-protect-yourself/#1e15105d29ac" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly every SSN has been compromised</a>. One of the most well-known events of this type was the <a href="https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/consumer-notice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Equifax data breach in 2017</a>, which left nearly 150 million Americans helpless as malicious actors gained, shared, and traded access to their records, including their SSNs. Others include a <a href="https://www.capitalone.com/facts2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2019 breach of Capital One</a> that saw 140,000 compromised SSNs, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/over-22-million-social-security-numbers-stolen-in-opm-hacks-agency-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 22 million SSNs compromised from the Office of Personnel Management</a>, and even a data breach of a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-defense-breach/u-s-agency-responsible-for-trumps-secure-communication-suffered-data-breach-letter-idUSKBN20E27A?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">US Defense Agency</a>. Once an attacker has access to an SSN and can associate it to the same subject‚Äôs other PII such as the corresponding full name, their capabilities for fraud and impersonation increase drastically. Often, all it takes to access an individual‚Äôs line of credit in digital systems is a full name and a SSN. This issue is especially pressing today, with interactions <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/banking-law/push-for-digital-id-tech-development-spurred-on-by-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">migrating online at breakneck pace</a> due to the global pandemic.</p><p>One of the larger issues is that a SSN is as persistent as one‚Äôs own shadow, due to an original number remaining [embedded](<a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0248-do-you-need-new-social-security-number#:~:text=in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0248-do-you-need-new-social-security-number#:~:text=in</a> your files.-,Applying for a New Number or Replacement Card,number and is using it.) in government systems, <strong>*even in the case of reissuance*</strong>. Additionally, it is etched into the deep inner workings of countless institutions and information businesses, meaning that nothing short of a paradigm shift can spur significant change. Even if we wanted to move to a new system, phasing out the old identifiers and migrating all Americans‚Äô records to a more secure system would take decades. Without abolishing the SSN overnight, how could we offer a more secure way to use it?</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="reimagining-the-social-security-number-by-separating-concerns"></a>Reimagining the Social Security Number by Separating Concerns<a class="hash-link" href="#reimagining-the-social-security-number-by-separating-concerns" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1056/0*IUrYGeaxXRTQjjtM" alt="Incremental workflow improvements to enable SSN+ security"></p><p><em>Incremental workflow improvements to enable SSN+ security (dotted steps)</em></p><p>We believe that there is no way to completely <strong>replace</strong> the SSN and the relationship it has across government agencies and private institutions without incurring massive unjustifiable expenses. Running a national identifier scheme such as the SSN system is staggeringly difficult to begin with, and unpopular to boot, triggering all kinds of defenses from civil society and financial institutions. Furthermore, it‚Äôs not even clear that a full ‚Äúrip-and-replace‚Äù approach would build additional security or solve most of the key problems. As Steven Bellovin wrote in <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pakwnb/replacing-social-security-numbers-is-harder-than-you-think" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Motherboard</a>:</p><p><em>The problem underlying identity theft is not the existence of (SSNs), but rather, how little authentication is done for a person</em>.</p><p>To reshape this system, we must first accept that any additions to the system must be incremental and come with a rollback strategy, like any other upgrade to critical information systems central to the banking system and federal government. We propose the addition of an opt-in authenticator to separate concerns, gradually shifting the SSN to serve as an identifier only and to double no longer as an authenticator. According to this proposal, if someone were to present another person‚Äôs SSN which has additional authentication enabled, it would be useless in granting access to resources and services, lowering the fraud potential, and thus the ‚Äústreet value,‚Äù of exfiltrated SSNs considerably.</p><p>The process would start with an individual voluntarily enrolling to receive an SSN+ package (as we‚Äôre calling it). This would require first passing the appropriate levels of identity proofing, not dissimilar from those necessary in the existing process of <a href="https://blog.ssa.gov/so-youve-lost-your-social-security-card" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SSN card replacement</a> or enrollments in other comparable identity documentation programs. De-enrollment would mirror this workflow with respect to identity proofing. A lost SSN+ package is handled in much the same way that a lost SSN is handled today.</p><p>Once equipped with an SSN+ package, a user can approach the institutions currently using their SSN as a knowledge-based authenticator and register their account‚Äôs support for SSN+ improved authentication. This re-enrollment involves little more than being presented with an additional challenge that only someone with the corresponding SSN+ package could correctly answer. Each new authentication challenge thereafter would similarly require a new SSN+ challenge.</p><p>For the institutions that wish to support SSN+ improved authentication to upgrade their security for their end-users, it is straightforward to modify their existing systems. They would add a flag to the user‚Äôs account indicating that SSN+ support has been enabled, as well as collecting a new ‚Äúshared seed value‚Äù generated by the user‚Äôs SSN+ package to check against future challenges.</p><p>The institution would then make minor adjustments to their existing workflows where the user is currently asked for their SSN as part of authentication. Specifically, after retrieving the user‚Äôs account, there is a new automated check SSN+ enablement. If SSN+ is not enabled, then the workflow proceeds just as before. However, if it is enabled, then in order to continue, the user must present a time-based verification code that can only be produced by their registered SSN+ package.</p><p>This approach has parallels in user experience to the time-based one-time password (TOTP) which enjoys increasingly wide adoption, and can be incorporated across a number of communication channels including web forms, telephone, and SMS. Due to its opt-in nature, this simply grants choice to users and systems that value security, and does not force any other workflows to be affected.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-privacy-possibility-frontier"></a>The Privacy Possibility Frontier<a class="hash-link" href="#the-privacy-possibility-frontier" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2010/0*X49O98uBkqg5-66D" alt="Proposed Architecture Diagram"></p><p><em>One possible privacy-preserving architecture for SSN+</em></p><p>With the right choice of architecture for the SSN+ package, we can generate a virtually unlimited number of new identifiers that serve as part of a privacy-preserving shell around the original SSN. We can derive so-called ‚Äúlinked identifiers‚Äù that:</p><ul><li>are meaningless by themselves but globally unique</li><li>do not leak sensitive data</li><li>cannot be used as an authenticator alone</li><li>are shareable across systems in a permissioned way</li><li>support interoperable standards.</li></ul><p>These disposable identifiers can be used directly in new systems that are built to address existing IT security and privacy issues, such as those designed for smart cities and next-generation business entity systems. By using interoperable standards such as W3C Decentralized Identifiers, this approach to user-controlled identifiers can be deployed in ways agnostic to the host country, system, or jurisdiction ‚Äî and compatible with their infrastructural investments and architectures.</p><p>In one possible implementation, the user could generate their own ‚Äúprivate keys‚Äù that not even the government knows about, creating an identity entirely under that individual‚Äôs ultimate control. This increase in the user‚Äôs control also reduces the government‚Äôs liability in the case of another breach, in that the exfiltrated data is useless without each user‚Äôs private keys. After the user is appropriately authenticated and authorized to receive an SSN+ package, the government or an authorized vendor would then securely send an SSN+ package to the user, which contains verifiable credentials issued by the government linking the user‚Äôs SSN to their private key through one-time-use identifiers. This package issuance is enabled through existing <a href="https://fpki.idmanagement.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">federal PKI</a>. The user could then generate ad-hoc identifiers for use in new situations or single interactions that cannot be linked back to their other ones. For each identifier, the user may demonstrate varying degrees of information attested by the government and without over-revealing information, such as:</p><ul><li>This identifier is backed by a legitimate SSN, but I won‚Äôt tell you which one</li><li>These are the last 4 digits of the linked SSN, but I won‚Äôt tell you the whole thing</li><li>This identifier is linked to a specific SSN, and it is the following‚Ä¶</li></ul><p>In the fully deployed version of this particular approach, even if an attacker were to completely breach and wrest control of federal government databases, they would be left with a stack of identifiers of little value because they cannot be correlated to individuals or converted to SSNs. The government could then freeze digital services so that no further damage could be committed, as opposed to ‚Äúletting the cat out of the bag,‚Äù such as when today‚Äôs attackers score a ‚Äúhoneypot‚Äù of useful personally identifiable information (PII) that can be resold and shared. In the case of a breach, a system based on SSN+ could be patched while in stasis and then rolled back to a trusted state with minimal disruption of services, and little erosion of security guarantees.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="alternatives-to-increasing-control-of-existing-systems"></a>Alternatives to Increasing Control of Existing Systems<a class="hash-link" href="#alternatives-to-increasing-control-of-existing-systems" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>We believe the system described above can incrementally deescalate the need for widespread national ID regimes through open standards-based approaches. We may even avoid a national ID system altogether in favor of alternative identity schemes where identities consist solely of publicly and privately issued credentials held and controlled by the user. Historically, reliance on national ID systems has enabled governments to discriminate against and deny the rights of individuals to <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/national-ids" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">purchase property, open a bank account, or receive government benefits</a>.</p><p>They also create massive liabilities for governments through data breaches. If there are other ways to achieve the core benefits of national ID systems, including fraud prevention and credit creation, then we support their thorough exploration. At the time of press, there are few such contenders on the horizon, and none currently feasible.</p><p>We think alternate forms of authentication and identification that do not rely on centralized national ID systems are a promising and practical way forward. In their gradual adoption, we can incrementally reduce reliance on centralized systems through system architectures that do the same job and put the user in charge without growing the purview of the structures in place, and without significantly increasing costs, liabilities, dependencies, or complexity for governments.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="contact-us"></a>Contact us<a class="hash-link" href="#contact-us" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><em>If you would like to discuss how we would deploy the architecture described above for a specific use case, please take 30 seconds to</em> <a href="https://www.spruceid.com/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>leave us a message</em></a><em>, and we will respond within 24 hours.</em> </p><p>Or just Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/sprucesystems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Twitter</em></a> &amp; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sprucesystemsinc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>LinkedIn</em></a>.</p></section><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/spruce">spruce</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/ssn">ssn</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/identity">identity</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about Reimagining the Social Security Number" href="/blog/reimagining-the-ssn"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_3-lP"><a href="/blog/decentralized-identity-on-tezos">Announcing Decentralized Identity on Tezos</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2020-08-27T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_Ta7i">August 27, 2020  ¬∑ 5 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo" href="https://github.com/obstropolos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/18144858?s=460&amp;u=c893f3c7ca61474a5d7891ea36ef22423b795cd0&amp;v=4" alt="Gregory Rocco"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/obstropolos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gregory Rocco</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">Lovable Scrumbag</small></div></div></header><section class="markdown"><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*t-I_SWlXpOJUOTpqzZ8jew.png" alt="spruce and tezos logos dancing slowly"></p><p>Today, we are proud to announce our collaboration with the Tezos ecosystem, with which we have begun working to add decentralized identity capabilities built using the latest W3C standards. Our first efforts will result in extensible open-source identity products built on Tezos, including tools for the issuance, storage, verification, and governance of trusted information to allow any Tezos account to demonstrate who (or what) they are on their own terms, without sacrificing privacy.</p><p>We are thrilled to be working with the team at TQ Tezos in order to bring digital identity to life, and are looking forward to working with ecosystem projects such as Tezos Domains, Taquito, Beacon, Kukai, and Agora in order to augment their initiatives with Tezos-based decentralized identities.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="digital-identity-and-blockchain-based-smart-contracts"></a>Digital identity and blockchain-based smart contracts<a class="hash-link" href="#digital-identity-and-blockchain-based-smart-contracts" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*HDhm6a5ygumwIwOc" alt="use case diagram"></p><p><em>Examples of opportunities to refactor trusted workflows</em></p><p>To drive impact outside of on-chain transactions and smart contracts, blockchains must construct read and write pointers to the real-world as secure digital representations. Anything from asset issuance, to business contract verification, to trusted oracles require some form of digital identity, which is the way we recognize, remember, and respond to other actors. We‚Äôve seen projects spend valuable engineering hours re-constructing the same digital identity components in order to satisfy their trust and compliance needs.</p><p>Spruce is building common identity infrastructure that offers standard and interoperable ways to manage things like documents, authorizations, and integrations with third-party verifiers. These processes are then used to establish credentials for people and things (e.g., account ownership, investor sophistication assessments, authoritative copies, data feeds, etc.) held by account controllers and presented at will without requiring intermediaries.
These are critical building blocks to enable use cases such as compliance for digital assets, transparent government, and scalable data storage without loss of integrity. This way, applications can focus more on their core business logic instead of reinventing identity components.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="why-tezos"></a>Why Tezos<a class="hash-link" href="#why-tezos" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>We believe the Tezos ecosystem is a strong fit for Spruce‚Äôs efforts considering its vision, community practices, and focus on high assurance. Additionally, the decentralized identity ecosystem has much to gain from the Tezos ecosystem‚Äôs reciprocal involvement. By focusing our efforts within a single ecosystem from the outset, we are able to ensure production readiness across a complete integrated stack so that solutions will function flawlessly from the end-user interfaces down to the blockchain protocol level.</p><p>Tezos‚Äô focus on governance and upgradable protocols aligns with the notion of trust frameworks in mapping human-made rules into machine-readable protocols. As an example, there are several common activities in the baking ecosystem, such as staking rewards auditing, which are excellent candidates for formalizing into verifiable credentials-based interactions.</p><p>We also look forward to interacting with Tezos‚Äô rich ecosystem of formal verification engineers to prove properties of our software, such as that it is impossible to issue a credential in an invalid state. We also anticipate collaborations using zero-knowledge protocols to advance the state of the art in the decentralized identity ecosystem, which has already pioneered selective credential disclosure using BBS+ signatures in conjunction with BLS12‚Äì381 (the Zcash pairing-friendly elliptic curve). There is immense opportunity for mutual gain at both the ecosystem and technology layers.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="our-vision"></a>Our vision<a class="hash-link" href="#our-vision" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Our long-term vision is to enable every Tezos wallet with identity capabilities and to allow any project to issue credentials for end-users to utilize throughout their various journeys. With these components, Tezos products will have standard capabilities to tie into reality: Tezos accounts can be selectively augmented with real-world credentials while preserving privacy, asset structuring time can be reduced from months to days, and transactions can generate credentials spawning off-chain interactions.</p><p>Historically, decentralized identifiers (DIDs) have relied on public blockchains to produce DID methods that are censorship-resistant, free of gatekeepers, and globally unique and consistent. However, we believe that decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials (VCs) are key to unlocking the true economic value of smart contracts by bridging on-chain accounts to real-world entities, assets, relationships, and regulators. They allow transactions to break out of the blockchain sandbox and directly impact or become impacted by real-world systems while remaining peer-to-peer.</p><p>For example, the EU-based eIDAS Observatory is discussing the use of blockchain-based DIDs within the eIDAS trust framework to take legally binding and non-repudiable actions tied to registered entities. The Verifiable Organizations Network has been adopted at the Government of British Columbia in Canada as the OrgBook to provide authentic and authoritative DID-based business identifiers and credentials. The Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation, established by recommendations from the G20 to prevent another financial crisis, is using verifiable credentials to establish trust and authenticity for business entities globally.</p><p>We believe that building the standard way to interact with verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers on Tezos will allow its smart contract ecosystem to fully leverage all such network effects regardless from which blockchain or network DIDs and VCs originate. This would supercharge smart contracts by building a reliable clutch to off-chain actors, assets, and legal frameworks.</p><p>Additionally, this allows identity to become a gateway to the Tezos ecosystem. A new user can be introduced and integrated into the Tezos ecosystem simply by receiving credentials and wanting to use a credential-enabled service. A DID Method alone does not necessarily add value to a network ‚Äî there needs to be usage.</p><p>We look forward to continued engagement with the Tezos ecosystem as we work to make decentralized identity on Tezos a reality.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="contact-us"></a>Contact us<a class="hash-link" href="#contact-us" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><em>If you would like to discuss how we would deploy the architecture described above for a specific use case, please take 30 seconds to</em> <a href="https://www.spruceid.com/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>leave us a message</em></a><em>, and we will respond within 24 hours.</em> </p><p>Or just Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/sprucesystems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Twitter</em></a> &amp; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sprucesystemsinc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>LinkedIn</em></a>.</p></section><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/spruce">spruce</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/tezos">tezos</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/identity">identity</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about Announcing Decentralized Identity on Tezos" href="/blog/decentralized-identity-on-tezos"><strong>Read More</strong></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_3-lP"><a href="/blog/introducing-spruce">Introducing Spruce</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2020-08-25T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_Ta7i">August 25, 2020  ¬∑ 4 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo" href="https://github.com/wyc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/858687?s=460&amp;v=4" alt="Wayne Change"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/wyc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wayne Change</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">Bodega Afficionado and CEO</small></div></div></header><section class="markdown"><p>![brand asset][(https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*sMqXocIDsrw2SiKn.png](<a href="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*ILg9HYN8JxQOSuk8ftFpkA.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*ILg9HYN8JxQOSuk8ftFpkA.png</a>))</p><p><em>Spruce is reimagining trusted interactions for enterprises and governments ‚Äî the stewards of the most foundational and impactful layers of infrastructure shaping our lives.</em></p><p>When‚Äôs the last time you felt comfortable sending or receiving important documents digitally? Have you ever been shocked at how much an online platform knows about you and wish you had more control over your identity? As a business, do your customers feel any of the above when they‚Äôre doing business with you?</p><p>For all the mountains of data and technology surging through every aspect of our lives ‚Äî business transactions, government services, staying connected with people, and getting our news ‚Äî there lacks the trust, belief, and authenticity that we need to feel safe. In the long run, this is not good for businesses, which rely on trust relationships with their customers and partners to transact. It‚Äôs not good for democratic governments and their citizens, which rely on public transparency and verifiable information for accountability. It‚Äôs also not good for the freedom of individuals, who feel their privacy and control eroding day by day by the actions of data-hungry corporations and overreaching government programs.</p><p>To do its part to redress this issue, <strong>*Spruce is reimagining trusted interactions for enterprises and governments ‚Äî the stewards of the most foundational and impactful layers of infrastructure shaping our lives**</strong>.* We believe that in any organization you can find people who wish public and private institutions respected an individual‚Äôs control over their own information and privacy. We are also pragmatists, who understand that these principles are most likely to be implemented at scale when they also make commercial and operational sense. We firmly believe that there are paths striking a balance that both respects individual liberty and allows for enterprise success.</p><p>We are creating open-source software products that help our customers go from untrusted data to verifiable information that can be shared privately and with consent. Our products enable complete lifecycle management for licenses, certificates, audit reports, registrations, and other mission-critical data that must remain secure while passing many hands. Our main workflows allow end-users to manage their own data, and for everyone else to have confidence in the consent and purpose of data shared by them. To achieve this, we will utilize a cadre of emerging data technologies, including the recent W3C Verifiable Credentials and W3C Decentralized Identifiers specifications, which have been designed to solve business problems while leaving ample room to champion the end user‚Äôs control within a data supply chain.</p><p>To best serve our customers, we will meet them where they are today by understanding how they must serve their own customers and internal stakeholders. We will, therefore, focus heavily on creating first-class support to link with existing identity and data appliances commonly found in enterprise environments, including identity servers, internal resource APIs, key management systems, ERPs, and cloud services. As an example, we know that for some organizations, critical infrastructure cannot be directly migrated to new publicly-downloadable mobile applications, and their existing X.509 and SAML-based workflows are extremely relevant and not going anywhere. Any new additions should acknowledge the prior work and build upon it where possible to prevent confusion. We favor approaches that tie in rather than replace, and incrementally demonstrate stability and value prior to increasing the deployment surface area.</p><p>With each new deployment of our products, we contribute to the increased adoption of privacy-enhanced protocols and practices that lay the groundwork for a more resilient future infrastructure through solid business cases. We will drive impact that increases decentralization and user control at the level that matters most, while making our customers profits and delighting their risk managers.</p><p>If you are interested in working together or hearing more about our approach, <a href="https://www.spruceid.com/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">please reach out</a>.
