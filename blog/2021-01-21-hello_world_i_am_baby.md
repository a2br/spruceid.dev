The rest of the site will be entirely devoted to documenting our projects. Please take your time, stay a while, and look not just at the explanatory sections and technical definitions, but also the examples. We have certain style and ergonomic approach which we hope comes across in our documentation. Our goal in setting up this site was to convey the identity of our products and the values of our team, rather than just a functional or transactional set of "user's manuals." This documentation is yours, though, not just in the sense that we wrote it for you-- feel free to [request](https://github.com/spruceid/spruceid.dev/issues/new/choose) "features" and "fixes" of it!

### Community is what you make of it

Writing as Spruce's Open Source "Yenta", I have a special remit to turn you, the wayward developer reading up on our products, from a repo-cloner into a community member. This starts always with the work, the repos, the cloning and forking.  Regardless of whether you have any intention of forking additions and extensions back into our repo, however, everyone who uses our products for anything, even for educating themselves, is a valued user.  As such, we're always happy to hear from you!

To this end, we've set up a three-step process. If you're using our work, please feel welcome to:
1. Introduce yourself on this website's github repo [discussion forum](https://github.com/spruceid/spruceid.dev/discussions) (on github discussions).
2. If you have any questions, feel free to open issues on the respective product repos ([didkit](https://github.com/spruceid/didkit#coming-soon), [credible](https://github.com/spruceid/didkit#coming-soon)) and use our [issue templates](https://github.com/spruceid/spruceid.dev/issues/new/choose) for feature requests, bug reports, or documentation problems.
3. If you have an urgent query, or want to talk about opening a PR and being a contributor, reach out to me directly [over email](mailto:juan.caballeroATspruceid.com)! They call me a yenta because I'm chatty and I like making introductions, so don't be shy!
