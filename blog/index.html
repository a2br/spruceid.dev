It allows you to resolve and manage DID documents, and also manage the entire lifecycle of Verifiable Credentials including their issuance, presentation, and verification.</p><p>Notably, it reuses the same codebase across command-line tooling, RESTful HTTP servers, and platform-specific SDKs to facilitate code-level interoperability and a low total cost of ownership. When building ecosystems using decentralized identity to enable verifiable information, many actors must share the same underlying data formats and processing algorithms across different roles.</p><p>We wrote DIDKit in Rust due to its memory safety, expressive type system, and suitability across a variety of systems and environments. For example, the Rust ecosystem has already explored WASM compilation targets in support of single-page apps running in browsers, and we wanted to be able to support those and also browser extensions with DID and VC operations.</p><p>The same codebase can also run nimbly on embedded systems with moderately constrained resources (memory in the megabytes and CPU in the megahertz).

Some pieces of information are inherent to an individual such as a photograph, while others are assigned such as a driver’s license number, or name on a birth certificate. In America, individuals are often assigned a number of assigned identifiers at birth, with one standing beyond all others as a critical but high-risk identifier: the social security number.</p><p>The optional nine-digit social security number (SSN) is at the core of every American’s administrative identity — and it is also a major attack vector for most kinds of financial fraud. It was originally <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v45n11/v45n11p29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">developed and deployed as a unique identifier</a> in the 1930s in order to track an individual’s wages over time. This was a critical activity to assess future government benefits under the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/ssact-toc.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Social Security Act</a>, as well as supporting other critical functions such as linking federal income tax and payroll accounting. In a pre-digital age, it became important as a federally issued unique identifier and found its way into most major government institutions from there, binding individuals to all kinds of records about them. Eventually, it became a means to enable the employment of an individual, and a requirement to access financial services and government-backed assistance programs.</p><p>Today, institutions will commonly request an SSN along with other supplemental forms of identity verification to create stronger guarantees that each individual has been reliably identified. In these cases, where it supplements identity assurance, it is being used as an “<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2017/10/23/ssn-for-authentication-is-all-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">authenticator” in addition to an identifier</a>. But it is as valuable to falsify identification as it is to verify it: it is a valuable target for malicious actors due to the plausibility and control it grants upon presentation when impersonating its proper subject.</p><p>Considering the increasing severity and frequency of digital breaches in recent years, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to believe that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/suzannerowankelleher/2019/08/01/everyones-social-security-number-has-been-compromised-heres-how-to-protect-yourself/#1e15105d29ac" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly every SSN has been compromised</a>. One of the most well-known events of this type was the <a href="https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/consumer-notice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Equifax data breach in 2017</a>, which left nearly 150 million Americans helpless as malicious actors gained, shared, and traded access to their records, including their SSNs. Others include a <a href="https://www.capitalone.com/facts2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2019 breach of Capital One</a> that saw 140,000 compromised SSNs, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/over-22-million-social-security-numbers-stolen-in-opm-hacks-agency-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 22 million SSNs compromised from the Office of Personnel Management</a>, and even a data breach of a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-defense-breach/u-s-agency-responsible-for-trumps-secure-communication-suffered-data-breach-letter-idUSKBN20E27A?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">US Defense Agency</a>. Once an attacker has access to an SSN and can associate it to the same subject’s other PII such as the corresponding full name, their capabilities for fraud and impersonation increase drastically. Often, all it takes to access an individual’s line of credit in digital systems is a full name and a SSN. This issue is especially pressing today, with interactions <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/banking-law/push-for-digital-id-tech-development-spurred-on-by-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">migrating online at breakneck pace</a> due to the global pandemic.</p><p>One of the larger issues is that a SSN is as persistent as one’s own shadow, due to an original number remaining [embedded](<a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0248-do-you-need-new-social-security-number#:~:text=in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0248-do-you-need-new-social-security-number#:~:text=in</a> your files.-,Applying for a New Number or Replacement Card,number and is using it.) in government systems, <strong>*even in the case of reissuance*</strong>. Additionally, it is etched into the deep inner workings of countless institutions and information businesses, meaning that nothing short of a paradigm shift can spur significant change. Even if we wanted to move to a new system, phasing out the old identifiers and migrating all Americans’ records to a more secure system would take decades. Without abolishing the SSN overnight, how could we offer a more secure way to use it?</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="reimagining-the-social-security-number-by-separating-concerns"></a>Reimagining the Social Security Number by Separating Concerns<a class="hash-link" href="#reimagining-the-social-security-number-by-separating-concerns" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1056/0*IUrYGeaxXRTQjjtM" alt="Incremental workflow improvements to enable SSN+ security"></p><p><em>Incremental workflow improvements to enable SSN+ security (dotted steps)</em></p><p>We believe that there is no way to completely <strong>replace</strong> the SSN and the relationship it has across government agencies and private institutions without incurring massive unjustifiable expenses. Running a national identifier scheme such as the SSN system is staggeringly difficult to begin with, and unpopular to boot, triggering all kinds of defenses from civil society and financial institutions. Furthermore, it’s not even clear that a full “rip-and-replace” approach would build additional security or solve most of the key problems. As Steven Bellovin wrote in <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/pakwnb/replacing-social-security-numbers-is-harder-than-you-think" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Motherboard</a>:</p><p><em>The problem underlying identity theft is not the existence of (SSNs), but rather, how little authentication is done for a person</em>.</p><p>To reshape this system, we must first accept that any additions to the system must be incremental and come with a rollback strategy, like any other upgrade to critical information systems central to the banking system and federal government. We propose the addition of an opt-in authenticator to separate concerns, gradually shifting the SSN to serve as an identifier only and to double no longer as an authenticator. According to this proposal, if someone were to present another person’s SSN which has additional authentication enabled, it would be useless in granting access to resources and services, lowering the fraud potential, and thus the “street value,” of exfiltrated SSNs considerably.</p><p>The process would start with an individual voluntarily enrolling to receive an SSN+ package (as we’re calling it). This would require first passing the appropriate levels of identity proofing, not dissimilar from those necessary in the existing process of <a href="https://blog.ssa.gov/so-youve-lost-your-social-security-card" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SSN card replacement</a> or enrollments in other comparable identity documentation programs. De-enrollment would mirror this workflow with respect to identity proofing. A lost SSN+ package is handled in much the same way that a lost SSN is handled today.</p><p>Once equipped with an SSN+ package, a user can approach the institutions currently using their SSN as a knowledge-based authenticator and register their account’s support for SSN+ improved authentication. This re-enrollment involves little more than being presented with an additional challenge that only someone with the corresponding SSN+ package could correctly answer. Each new authentication challenge thereafter would similarly require a new SSN+ challenge.</p><p>For the institutions that wish to support SSN+ improved authentication to upgrade their security for their end-users, it is straightforward to modify their existing systems. They would add a flag to the user’s account indicating that SSN+ support has been enabled, as well as collecting a new “shared seed value” generated by the user’s SSN+ package to check against future challenges.</p><p>The institution would then make minor adjustments to their existing workflows where the user is currently asked for their SSN as part of authentication. Specifically, after retrieving the user’s account, there is a new automated check SSN+ enablement. If SSN+ is not enabled, then the workflow proceeds just as before. However, if it is enabled, then in order to continue, the user must present a time-based verification code that can only be produced by their registered SSN+ package.</p><p>This approach has parallels in user experience to the time-based one-time password (TOTP) which enjoys increasingly wide adoption, and can be incorporated across a number of communication channels including web forms, telephone, and SMS. Due to its opt-in nature, this simply grants choice to users and systems that value security, and does not force any other workflows to be affected.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-privacy-possibility-frontier"></a>The Privacy Possibility Frontier<a class="hash-link" href="#the-privacy-possibility-frontier" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2010/0*X49O98uBkqg5-66D" alt="Proposed Architecture Diagram"></p><p><em>One possible privacy-preserving architecture for SSN+</em></p><p>With the right choice of architecture for the SSN+ package, we can generate a virtually unlimited number of new identifiers that serve as part of a privacy-preserving shell around the original SSN. We can derive so-called “linked identifiers” that:</p><ul><li>are meaningless by themselves but globally unique</li><li>do not leak sensitive data</li><li>cannot be used as an authenticator alone</li><li>are shareable across systems in a permissioned way</li><li>support interoperable standards.</li></ul><p>These disposable identifiers can be used directly in new systems that are built to address existing IT security and privacy issues, such as those designed for smart cities and next-generation business entity systems. By using interoperable standards such as W3C Decentralized Identifiers, this approach to user-controlled identifiers can be deployed in ways agnostic to the host country, system, or jurisdiction — and compatible with their infrastructural investments and architectures.</p><p>In one possible implementation, the user could generate their own “private keys” that not even the government knows about, creating an identity entirely under that individual’s ultimate control. This increase in the user’s control also reduces the government’s liability in the case of another breach, in that the exfiltrated data is useless without each user’s private keys. After the user is appropriately authenticated and authorized to receive an SSN+ package, the government or an authorized vendor would then securely send an SSN+ package to the user, which contains verifiable credentials issued by the government linking the user’s SSN to their private key through one-time-use identifiers. This package issuance is enabled through existing <a href="https://fpki.idmanagement.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">federal PKI</a>. The user could then generate ad-hoc identifiers for use in new situations or single interactions that cannot be linked back to their other ones. For each identifier, the user may demonstrate varying degrees of information attested by the government and without over-revealing information, such as:</p><ul><li>This identifier is backed by a legitimate SSN, but I won’t tell you which one</li><li>These are the last 4 digits of the linked SSN, but I won’t tell you the whole thing</li><li>This identifier is linked to a specific SSN, and it is the following…</li></ul><p>In the fully deployed version of this particular approach, even if an attacker were to completely breach and wrest control of federal government databases, they would be left with a stack of identifiers of little value because they cannot be correlated to individuals or converted to SSNs. The government could then freeze digital services so that no further damage could be committed, as opposed to “letting the cat out of the bag,” such as when today’s attackers score a “honeypot” of useful personally identifiable information (PII) that can be resold and shared. In the case of a breach, a system based on SSN+ could be patched while in stasis and then rolled back to a trusted state with minimal disruption of services, and little erosion of security guarantees.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="alternatives-to-increasing-control-of-existing-systems"></a>Alternatives to Increasing Control of Existing Systems<a class="hash-link" href="#alternatives-to-increasing-control-of-existing-systems" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>We believe the system described above can incrementally deescalate the need for widespread national ID regimes through open standards-based approaches. We may even avoid a national ID system altogether in favor of alternative identity schemes where identities consist solely of publicly and privately issued credentials held and controlled by the user. Historically, reliance on national ID systems has enabled governments to discriminate against and deny the rights of individuals to <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/national-ids" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">purchase property, open a bank account, or receive government benefits</a>.</p><p>They also create massive liabilities for governments through data breaches. If there are other ways to achieve the core benefits of national ID systems, including fraud prevention and credit creation, then we support their thorough exploration. At the time of press, there are few such contenders on the horizon, and none currently feasible.</p><p>We think alternate forms of authentication and identification that do not rely on centralized national ID systems are a promising and practical way forward. In their gradual adoption, we can incrementally reduce reliance on centralized systems through system architectures that do the same job and put the user in charge without growing the purview of the structures in place, and without significantly increasing costs, liabilities, dependencies, or complexity for governments.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="contact-us"></a>Contact us<a class="hash-link" href="#contact-us" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><em>If you would like to discuss how we would deploy the architecture described above for a specific use case, please take 30 seconds to</em> <a href="https://www.spruceid.com/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>leave us a message</em></a><em>, and we will respond within 24 hours.</em> </p><p>Or just Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/sprucesystems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Twitter</em></a> &amp; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sprucesystemsinc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>LinkedIn</em></a>.</p></section><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/spruce">spruce</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/ssn">ssn</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/identity">identity</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_3-lP"><a href="/blog/field-notes-2">Spruce Developer Field Notes #2</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2020-10-07T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_Ta7i">October 7, 2020  · 5 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo" href="https://github.com/obstropolos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/18144858?s=460&amp;u=c893f3c7ca61474a5d7891ea36ef22423b795cd0&amp;v=4" alt="Gregory Rocco"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/obstropolos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gregory Rocco</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">Lovable Scrumbag</small></div></div></header><section class="markdown"><p>At Spruce, we’re building software to power the future of digital identity.

We see Credible as the <em>Amazon Basics</em> of credential wallets for the consumption, storage, and presentation of verifiable credentials on Android and iOS. It will be free to download and use, and it will support the core credential formats and protocols.</p><p>Credible will be both a fully usable real-world production wallet and a reference implementation demonstrating best practices for a cross-platform mobile application managing DIDs and VCs. In addition to supporting W3C Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers, its development will be further informed by emerging standards work including outputs from the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/secure-data-storage.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Secure Data Store WG</a>, <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/universal-wallet-interop-spec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universal Wallet 2020</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0160-connection-protocol/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">select Aries RFCs</a>, <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DIDComm</a>, <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Presentation Exchange</a>, and more. Over time, we are committed to maintaining this wallet and supporting the most open protocols and standards as they emerge.</p><p>The core functionality for Credible will be provided by our Rust libraries, which package the same small set of cryptographic dependencies already vetted and used in trusted projects such as <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/ursa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyperledger Ursa</a>.. Since security engineering is foremost among our concerns, Credible will natively take advantage of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/certificate_key_and_trust_services/keys/storing_keys_in_the_secure_enclave" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS Secure Enclave</a> and <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android Keystore</a> key management options, although a build for older phones will also be built with the maximum security guarantees possible given its reduced featureset. We have budgeted and roadmapped for external security guidance and review at every major version.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="credibles-architecture"></a>Credible’s architecture<a class="hash-link" href="#credibles-architecture" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>To enable cross-platform deployments, we considered implementing fully native applications rather than using frameworks such as Flutter, Xamarin, and React Native. We ultimately chose to build using Flutter to avoid the complexity of mixed-origin <a href="http://npm.broofa.com/?q=react-native" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dependency graphs</a>. Flutter also had a slightly more beaten path for embedding Rust through C ABIs. So far, we have implemented a working Flutter build using our Rust libraries, and are now busy stabilizing and integrating all the moving parts to demonstrate basic credential functionality.</p><p>Despite the design choices for our reference app, Credible’s modular architecture still allows it to be used with React Native, Xamarin, pulled in as an SDK to fully native applications, and to augment live applications with active users by adding DID/VC functionality. The high level architecture of Credible is as follows:</p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1324/0*bm10yzhoGgknf5nd" alt="Credible architecture"></p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="our-goals"></a>Our goals<a class="hash-link" href="#our-goals" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>We are not trying to create <em>one credential wallet to rule them all</em>, because we do not want to be in the rent-seeking vendor-lock-in business; we are not making a freemium or advertising-supported free software product. Rather, we are building a modular all-weather wallet toolkit that can be mixed and matched into limitless use cases, with an evolving production-ready reference implementation that anyone can download on their phones for free, just like any other app. User-centric, open-source, secure software will be a long time coming if redundant and incompatible wallets proliferate, reinvent every wheel, and waste all their resources competing for oxygen and attention. We need an open wallet in common, stat.</p><p>We believe that the future of user-centric credential wallets is a strong base suite of core credentialing functions, tailored to use cases and user experiences with last-mile “skins”, integrations, and profiles. into context-rich verticals such as finance, healthcare, government, and supply chain. We are therefore building the modular base and invite you to come build with us.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="contact-us"></a>Contact us<a class="hash-link" href="#contact-us" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><em>If you would like to discuss how we would deploy the architecture described above for a specific use case, please take 30 seconds to</em> <a href="https://www.spruceid.com/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>leave us a message</em></a><em>, and we will respond within 24 hours.</em> </p><p>Or just Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/sprucesystems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Twitter</em></a> &amp; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sprucesystemsinc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>LinkedIn</em></a>.</p></section><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/spruce">spruce</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/tezos">tezos</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/pizza">pizza</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_3-lP"><a href="/blog/spruce-origin-story">Spruce&#x27;s Origins, Decentralized Markets, and Identity</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2020-09-29T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_Ta7i">September 29, 2020  · 4 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo" href="https://github.com/wyc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/858687?s=460&amp;v=4" alt="Wayne Change"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/wyc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wayne Change</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">Bodega Afficionado and CEO</small></div></div></header><section class="markdown"><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*sMqXocIDsrw2SiKn.png" alt="chaotic urban life crosssection"></p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="what-problem-does-spruce-solve-how-did-spruce-come-to-be"></a>What problem does Spruce solve? How did Spruce come to be?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-problem-does-spruce-solve-how-did-spruce-come-to-be" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Spruce is a digital identity company that reimagines trusted interactions for enterprises and governments. We help our customers create trusted digital ecosystems that reduce transaction costs for business dealings and government services by incorporating real-world facts throughout their workflows in a standards-based way.</p><p>Our products handle statements about an ecosystem’s actors and assets, including certificates, licenses, audit reports, and formal approvals, packaging them digitally so that they are tamper-proof, information minimizing, and traceable within a data supply chain. They can then be shared privately and securely to correctly permissioned parties. To foster transparency and interoperability, we will release our core products as open source.</p><p>The Spruce team first worked closely together for a number of years at ConsenSys, where we gained extensive experience collaborating with enterprises and governments on emerging technologies such as digital identity, applied cryptography, cryptoeconomics, and smart contracts. While at ConsenSys, our team won the NYC flagship BigApps competition in 2019 for our approach to solving real estate management for the NYCEDC using digital identity for assets.
We also participated in several global digital identity standards bodies and industry groups, and continue to do so today. After our departure, we reflected upon our collective learnings and decided that this was the most important and meaningful problem that we could solve.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="why-is-decentralized-identity-important"></a>Why is decentralized identity important?<a class="hash-link" href="#why-is-decentralized-identity-important" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>We believe that decentralized markets, which transact in a more peer-to-peer way as opposed to through a few (or singular) powerful brokers, have enormous potential to make all participants better off except for rent-seeking centralized actors. It also increases the control and privacy enjoyed by individuals and smaller companies. Many classical economists interpret “free markets” as free from economic rents, compatible with regulatory frameworks and other forms of governance. To enable this shift, trust brokering too must move to a decentralized model.</p><p>For the most part, people are comfortable with stepping into Uber cars and Airbnb homes. These brands go great lengths to build trust and credibility, including background checks, million-dollar home guarantees, reputation systems, and online dispute resolution. This is also why people are generally not okay sending a transaction to a random hash address on a publicly-viewable blockchain and then stepping into the next car that pulls up. We think that verifiable information is critical enabling the three pillars of market design, a theory in which the economist Alvin Roth stipulates the necessity of thickness, congestion, and safety across all markets.</p><p>To ensure compatibility with peer-to-peer ways to transact, we must also adopt peer-to-peer ways to handle the issuance, transfer, and verification of trusted information. Consider a rideshare driver selling services within a decentralized marketplace who presents a valid license and driving history digitally-signed by the local DMV, proof of insurance from Geico, and a clean background check issued by Checkr (the same company used by Uber), all privately and securely without an intermediary. With this model, we are that much closer to a reality in which the trust portion of transaction costs within a decentralized market are no longer prohibitive, and the platform’s take of the revenue moves from 25% to $0.25. The surplus goes to the consumers and actual service providers.</p><p>We therefore think decentralized identity is important because it is beneficial to user control and privacy while also making good business sense. We think decentralized identity is key to enabling a myriad of new configurations for specialization and trade, and we view our open source products as tools for digital market design practitioners who structure markets by improving thickness, congestion, and safety.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="contact-us"></a>Contact us<a class="hash-link" href="#contact-us" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><em>If you would like to discuss how we would deploy the architecture described above for a specific use case, please take 30 seconds to</em> <a href="https://www.spruceid.com/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>leave us a message</em></a><em>, and we will respond within 24 hours.</em> </p><p>Or just Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/sprucesystems" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Twitter</em></a> &amp; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/sprucesystemsinc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>LinkedIn</em></a>.</p></section><footer class="row margin-vert--lg"><div class="col"><strong>Tags:</strong><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/spruce">spruce</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/dif">dif</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/nyc">nyc</a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="margin-bottom--sm blogPostTitle_3-lP"><a href="/blog/field-notes-1">Spruce Developer Field Notes #1</a></h2><div class="margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2020-09-08T00:00:00.000Z" class="blogPostDate_Ta7i">September 8, 2020  · 3 min read</time></div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo" href="https://github.com/obstropolos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/18144858?s=460&amp;u=c893f3c7ca61474a5d7891ea36ef22423b795cd0&amp;v=4" alt="Gregory Rocco"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><h4 class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/obstropolos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gregory Rocco</a></h4><small class="avatar__subtitle">Lovable Scrumbag</small></div></div></header><section class="markdown"><p>At Spruce, we’re building software to power the future of digital identity.

One other consideration for Rust was for embedded and IoT devices in the future as they harness credentials and use them in the performance of discrete tasks.</p><p>We are happy to report that our VC library passes all tests required by the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/vc-test-suite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C Verifiable Claims Working Group</a> test suite to be considered a conforming implementation.

As a refresher, a decentralized identifier (DID) relies on DID documents to establish authentication, and operations on DID documents themselves, including creation, resolution, updating, and deactivation, as described by a DID method. We are therefore currently in the early stages of developing a DID method based on Tezos, incorporating <a href="https://gitlab.com/tzip/tzip" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TZIPs</a> such as TZIP-16 and eventually producing TZIPs from our work.</p><p>Public ledger-based DIDs are rife with privacy concerns, and we are taking the following approaches with our DID method specification:</p><ul><li>Encouraging off-chain interactions where possible by (1) not requiring a public transaction prior to DID resolution and usage, and (2) considering the interplay with privacy-preserving DID methods such as <a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">did:peer</a>, which should actually serve the brunt of interactions to prevent unnecessary information exposure.</li><li>Limiting the scope towards providing only authentication via keypairs thereby ameliorating many concerns by the community <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-core/issues/382" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">around service endpoints</a>. We are considering the incorporation of the <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KERI</a> protocol to keep things straightforward.</li><li>Working closely with engineers from the Tezos ecosystem to provide implementations in Lorentz and/or LIGO for the DID document management smart contracts.
