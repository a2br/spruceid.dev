We’re happy to announce that we have [joined the W3C as an official member.](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List#xS)

The W3C has continually demonstrated excellence in the development of Web standards, and has been instrumental in the development and implementation of [verifiable credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) and [decentralized identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/). As participatory members of the [Credentials Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/), we felt that it’s important to become official members and solidify our commitment to the continued development of open, interoperable standards. We see the W3C membership not only as an important cornerstone of our identity efforts, but also as an opportunity to further our partnerships with other participating organizations, continue to lead the discussion on standards, and continue to promote an open internet.
