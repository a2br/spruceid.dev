Weâ€™re happy to announce that we have joined the DIF as an official associate member.

The DIF has existed as a cornerstone of standards development for decentralized identity, with its work being integral to the creation of foundational components and protocols. As frequent contributors to DIF, we felt that it was important to become an official associate member and solidify our commitment to the continued development of open, interoperable decentralized identity systems. We see our DIF membership as a means to continue to push decentralized identity forward and collaborate with other members to shape the future of trusted interactions worldwide.
